Chosen SDLC: Agile with Scrum
Rationale: Management is not required. The chatbot is a small project, and there is no need for anyone to have a place at the table as a manager or PM. Additionally, there are many, mostly non-complex or trivial, features that can be quickly implemented. This can be accomplished quickly, and means that there is not a dependence on complex testing, and additionally the tasks can be completed by individuals working on their own. Most features can be completed and implemented independent of the groupm so a simple backlog can be created and members can draw new tasks from it as they complete tasks. Work in groups is unnecessary due to the size of team and project, and communication outside of the programming process is all that is necessary.

Brief Project Description

We have decided to implement a chatbot who is somewhat intoxicated but coherent and able to learn from
user interaction. This bot will interact with the user based on pre-programmed sentence structures as well as
learned response constructs. Natural language processing will be used to determine parts of speech from user 
input. 

Phases of SDLC
- Construct feature set
- Discuss and agree on coding and design standards
- Divide features among programmers
- Test each implemented feature thoroughly
- Test complete bot

- Implement data pulling from input

--get natural language parser (OpenNLP)
----Time Expected: 3 hours
----Time Actual: 4 hours (need to install using Maven, took more time)

--get noun and verb from input
----Time Expected: 30 min
----Time Actual: 1 hour (needed to work out Eclipse kinks)
